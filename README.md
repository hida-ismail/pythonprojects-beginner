<h1>Python Beginner Level Projects</h1>
<p>Welcome to my collection of beginner-level Python projects! Each project has been designed to help strengthen core programming skills while having fun. Below is a brief description of each project included in this repository.</p>

<h2>1. BMI Calculator</h2>
<p>A simple Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator that takes a user's weight and height as inputs and calculates their BMI, helping to determine their health status.</p>

<h2>2. Guess the Number</h2>
<p>A fun game where the program selects a random number, and the user has to guess it within a certain range. With each guess, the program provides hints to help the player.</p>

<h2>3. Guess the Number (User Version)</h2>
<p>This version allows the user to select the number, while the program tries to guess it using a binary search algorithm or similar logic. The user provides feedback after each guess.</p>

<h2>4. The Hangman Game</h2>
<p>A word-guessing game where the player must guess the letters in a hidden word. Incorrect guesses lead to a hangman figure being drawn, and the player wins by guessing the word before the figure is completed.</p>

<h2>5. Rock, Paper, Scissors</h2>
<p>A simple implementation of the classic hand game between the player and the computer. The program randomly selects between rock, paper, or scissors, and the playerâ€™s choice is compared to determine a winner.</p>

<h2>6. Secret Message</h2>
<p>A fun project where a message is hidden or scrambled, and the program reveals or decodes the secret message, bringing a little mystery to your coding!</p>
